In this article I will talk about my experience with integrationg Pagefind into a Vite based project, I will talk about why I wanted Pagefind, what the problem was and how I ended up solving it.

## What is pagefind?

Pagefind is a library used to add search to a website, quote from the creators of Pagefind:

> Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your usersâ€™ bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure.

Like it states above, Pagefind is a "static" search library, this means it can analyse static content and create a searchable index from that content. This content can be any form of text: HTML, JSON, plaintext, etc.
